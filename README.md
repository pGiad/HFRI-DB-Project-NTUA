# H.F.R.I. Database Management
Semester Project for DBMS class in Electrical and Computer Engineering at National and Technical University of Athens during Spring Semester 2022.

In this group project we create a hypothetical Database for Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation (H.F.R.I.). After the creation of the Database and the insertion of randomly generated data, we develop an appropriate User Interface from where the data of the database can be accessed.
